The AT-G2Y are twin fans, where two DWDI forward curved impellers are mounted, inside two identical scrolls, on a common, solid shaft. The scrolls are connected with steel channel sections bolted to the scrolls, and supported on bolted feet, to be ordered separately.  The reinforced solid shaft is supported on just two bearings, with one impeller overhung, and extends on one side only.  The reinforced bearings have conical-sleeve locking, and are mounted into spider-shaped holders, bolted on the scroll side-plates.  The proper LG or RD version must be specified in the order. Available from the size 7-7 to the size 18-18.  The standard fan can be freely rotated, to allow installation with orientation 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°, as defined in ISO 13349.  Special feet may be required for some installations.
