Version specifically developed to cover the larger size range: 1120, 1250 and 1400, and intended for light duty operation.  Sizes 1120 and 1250 are supported on strong rectangular side frames, made of hot-rolled steel sections, and designed in four different models, to properly align the bearing supporting member, according to the selected orientation.  They allow, if needed, repositioning the fan into each of the four orientations 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°, according to ISO 13349. The 1400 size, instead, has side frames differently shaped, according to the specified orientation.  Impellers are supported on special, heavy-duty roller bearings, inside cast iron pillow blocks with grease points.
