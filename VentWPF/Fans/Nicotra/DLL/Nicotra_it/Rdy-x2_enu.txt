Version specifically developed to cover the larger size range: 1120, 1250 and 1400.  Intended for operation at higher pressure levels, it is supported on strong rectangular side frames, made of welded steel sections, with a different design according to the required orientation.  Each one of four different variations of each size allows installation with one of the four orientations 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°, as defined in ISO 13349. The impeller is supported on special, heavy-duty roller bearings inside cast-iron pillow blocks with grease point.
