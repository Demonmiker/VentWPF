The AT-G2T are twin fans, where two DWDI forward curved impellers are mounted, inside two identical scrolls, on a common, solid shaft. The scrolls are supported on galvanised-steel frames, welded on the scroll sides and connected together with steel bars forming a stiff structure. The reinforced solid shaft is supported on just two bearings, with one impeller overhung, and extends on one side only.  The reinforced bearings have conical-sleeve locking, and are mounted into spider-shaped holders, bolted on the scroll side-plates.  The proper LG or RD version must be specified in the order. Available from the size 7-7 to the size 18-18.  The standard fan can be freely rotated, to allow installation with orientation 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°, as defined in ISO 13349.
